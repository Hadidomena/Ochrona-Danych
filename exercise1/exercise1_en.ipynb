    "\n",
    "### What is Caesar Cipher?\n",
    "Simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Caesar Cipher is Insecure\n",
    "1. **Tiny key space** - Only 25-32 possible keys\n",
    "2. **Statistical patterns preserved** - Letter frequencies remain\n",
    "3. **No diffusion** - Each character encrypted independently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Short RC4 Keys are Insecure\n",
    "1. **Brute-forceable** - 17,576 combinations for 3-char keys\n",
    "2. **No authentication** - No way to verify decryption\n",
